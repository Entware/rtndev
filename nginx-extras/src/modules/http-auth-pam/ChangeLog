2015-02-04  sto@iti.es

	* Version 1.4.
	* Cleanup PAM responses on error, the module was not doing it, causing
	  memory leaks (thanks to Michael Koziarski for the report).

2013-09-17  sto@iti.es

	* Version 1.3.
	* Added support to export HOST and REQUEST variables to the PAM ENVIRONMENT.
	  Thanks to Ruben Jenster for the  initial patch, his version is available
	  from https://github.com/r10r/ngx_http_auth_pam_module; my version uses his
	  implementation but only if the user sets the ``pam_auth_set_pam_env``
	  flag.
	* Fixed bug from http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=+721702
	  (ngx_module_t commands array should end with a ngx_null_command); the bug
	  was already fixed on the PAM_ENV patch, but I forgot about it until I went
	  back to my svn repository to add the debian patch... better latter than
	  never... ;)

2010-11-15  sto@iti.upv.es
